Python job scheduling for humans. Run Python functions (or any other callable) periodically using a friendly syntax.

- A simple to use API for scheduling jobs, made for humans.
- In-process scheduler for periodic jobs. No extra processes needed!
- Very lightweight and no external dependencies.
- Excellent test coverage.
- Tested on Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9


:doc:`Example <examples>`
-------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install schedule

.. code-block:: python

    import schedule
    import time

    def job():
        print("I'm working...")

    schedule.every(10).minutes.do(job)
    schedule.every().hour.do(job)
    schedule.every().day.at("10:30").do(job)
    schedule.every().monday.do(job)
    schedule.every().wednesday.at("13:15").do(job)
    schedule.every().minute.at(":17").do(job)

    while True:
        schedule.run_pending()
        time.sleep(1)

When **not** to use Schedule
----------------------------
Let's be honest, Schedule is not a 'one size fits all' scheduling library.
This library is designed to be a simple solution for simple scheduling problems.
You should probably look somewhere else if you need:

* Job persistence (remember schedule between restarts)
* Exact timing (sub-second precision execution)
* Concurrent execution (multiple threads)
* Localization (time zones, workdays or holidays)


**Schedule does not account for the time it takes for the job function to execute.**
To guarantee a stable execution schedule you need to move long-running jobs off the main-thread (where the scheduler runs).
See :doc:`parallel-execution` for a sample implementation.
