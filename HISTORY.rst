0.3.2 (2015-07-02)
++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed issues where scheduling a job with a functools.partial as the job function fails. Thanks @dylwhich.
- Fixed an issue where scheduling a job to run every >= 2 days would cause the initial execution to happen one day early. Thanks @WoLfulus for identifying this and providing a fix.
- Added a FAQ item to describe how to schedule a job that runs only once.

0.3.1 (2014-09-03)
++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed an issue with unicode handling in setup.py that was causing trouble on Python 3 and Debian (https://github.com/dbader/schedule/issues/27). Thanks to @waghanza for reporting it.

0.3.0 (2014-06-14)
++++++++++++++++++

- Added support for scheduling jobs on specific weekdays. Example: ``schedule.every().tuesday.do(job)`` or ``schedule.every().wednesday.at("13:15").do(job)`` (Thanks @abultman.)

0.2.1 (2013-11-20)
++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed history (no code changes).

0.2.0 (2013-11-09)
++++++++++++++++++

- This release introduces two new features in a backwards compatible way:
- Allow jobs to cancel repeated execution: Jobs can be cancelled by calling ``schedule.cancel_job()`` or by returning ``schedule.CancelJob`` from the job function. (Thanks to @cfrco and @matrixise.)
- Updated ``at_time()`` to allow running jobs at a particular time every hour. Example: ``every().hour.at(':15').do(job)`` will run ``job`` 15 minutes after every full hour. (Thanks @mattss.)
- Refactored unit tests to mock ``datetime`` in a cleaner way. (Thanks @matts.)

0.1.11 (2013-07-30)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed an issue with ``next_run()`` throwing a ``ValueError`` exception when the job queue is empty. Thanks to @dpagano for pointing this out and thanks to @mrhwick for quickly providing a fix.

+++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed issue with ``at_time`` jobs not running on the same day the job is created (Thanks to @mattss)

0.1.9 (2013-05-27)
++++++++++++++++++

- Added ``schedule.next_run()``
- Added ``schedule.idle_seconds()``
- Args passed into ``do()`` are forwarded to the job function at call time
- Increased test coverage to 100%


0.1.8 (2013-05-21)

- Changed default ``delay_seconds`` for ``schedule.run_all()`` to 0 (from 60)
